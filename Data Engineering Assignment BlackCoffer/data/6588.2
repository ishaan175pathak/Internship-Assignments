In 2020 India became the 5th largest automobile market in the world. While this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment. How? Well, India is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According to the Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in India had unhealthy air quality.NoneNoneTherefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with EVs (Electric Vehicles) and Hydrogen Running Vehicles.

Well, currently most of the EV components are imported from China, yet nothing much to worry about, huge Indian Automobile Industries are trying to make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made in India, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.

And here The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel) for batteries of EVs from Rio Tuba, a mine, Japan purifies it and The US makes batteries out of them and uses them in EVs. Now since demand is increasing, the mining of Rio Tuba is increasing too which is affecting the Rainforests of the Philippines and its ecosystem, making us question “Is it even a solution?” None
